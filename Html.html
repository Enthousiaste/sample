      <h2>CHUTIYA</h2>
      <p>
        <mark>CHUTIYA</mark> is a Hindi word that has different meanings depending on the context.
        It can refer to a lock of hair on the top of the head, a lock of hair kept by 
        traditionalist Hindus, or to be <strong> under one's thumb,</strong> meaning to be under complete
        control. It can also refer to a derogatory term for a man who lives off his
          <mark>wife's prostitution</mark> or someone who kills themselves by <em> "excess of venery,</em>" i.e.
         by catching a sexually transmitted disease. The Chutiya people are an Indigenous
          Assamese people or an ethnic group originating in the Indian state of Assam and 
          are the descendants of the Sino-Tibetan family of Mongoloid stock. There are 
          three categories of chutia: chutiya, chaman chutiya, and sir chutiya.
